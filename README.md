# Algo-and-leetcode-grinding
This is my repo where I will post  my solutions  daily (Hopefully :) !) for my cracking the coding interview solutions and leetcode solutions for my review before any interviews

## Practice practice and practice
This will help me get better at testing myself on the spot for any interview.


## GNU Debugger
I will be using a debugger to solve my errors rather than placing print statements.

## Languages & Testing

I will mainly work with C++ but will try to do a little bit in Java or Python!
All compilation will be done in terminal rather than clicking a button here or there
All solutions will be tested against multiple test cases!!
